A multiword unit list was made using Antgram (https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antgram/)
with the following parameters:
- 3-grams to 5-grams
- Minimum frequency of 20 and minimum document frequency of 20
- Numbers replaced by #
- No open slots
- Top 1000 sorted by frequency

A screenshot of Antgram with the settinngs is available in this folder

Ngrams were delted from the list if...

- They were used in only one channel (e.g. ‘the ABC News’)
- N-grams that were actually 2 words (e.g. ‘the country’s’)
- Parts (e.g. ‘the same time’ and ‘at the same’ were deleted, ‘at the same time’ was not)
- all 3-grams that included apostrophes (e.g. ‘we’re seeing’, ‘we’ve seen’ )
- Any n-gram containing 2 numbers and one word (e.g. the # #)
- N-grams with ‘the [noun] and’ (e.g. ‘the pandemic and’, ‘the world and’)
- Any n-grams that were extracted because there was a reoccurring segment in many videos, for example most ABC News videos ended like this:
