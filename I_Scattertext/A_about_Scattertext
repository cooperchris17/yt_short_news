Scattertext (Kessler, 2017) is a tool for comparing and visualising words that are characteristic of one category compared with another.

The interactive plot allows users to click on words and see how they are used in context in the text.

For this project Scattertext plots were produced to compare a YouTube news channel in Japan with one in South Korea, 
one in the U.S. with one in China and one in the U.K. with one in Qatar.

The aim is to allow learners to explore the visualisations and find language differences between the two channels.
