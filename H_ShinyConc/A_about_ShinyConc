ShinyConc (http://shinyconc.de/) is an open source tool for creating a custom concordancer powered by R.

The concordancer can be deployed online, so it can easily be used by language learners without having to download corpora or any other tools

The ShinyConc website has very clear guidelines about setting up the concordancer.

The files in this folder show how I got my data into the required format for ShinyConc

When deploying the app online, I ran into a couple of problems

1. I had to reduce the size of the corpus I uploaded to ShinyConc
- When I tried to upload a .csv file with all of the data in it, the file was too large
- and there is an upload limit of 6000 files (when uploading the corpus as .txt files)
- so I resampled the corpus to have 490 files for each channel (except DW News, which only had 419 files) - 5809 files in total
- therefore learners did not have accesss to the full corpus, but a sample
- as they were mainly searching for frequent items, this did not seem to be problematic 

2. Most importantly, I had to make a small change to the R code to deploy the app online
- basically I had to change all occurences of 'install.packages' to 'library' (this didn't seem to be mentioned in the documentation, but it worked for me)
- a screenshot of the changes is available in this folder


After getting the metadata in the correct format, I uploaded the metadata file at: http://shinyconc.de/builder/
- then added the txt files as instructed in the ShinyConc guidelines
- then deployed the app to shinyapps.io (after making the previously mentioned changes)

Here is the link to the deployed app:
