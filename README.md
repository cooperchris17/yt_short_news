This repository contains Python code, additional data, and more detailed explanations to accompany the paper:
'A corpus of short YouTube news videos to inform course design and materials development in an EFL university setting in Japan.'

The paper was presented at CALL 2022 (https://conferences.castledown.com/call2022/) 8-10 July 2022.

The layout of the folders has been designed in a way that anybody interested in replicating the research should be able to follow through the folders in order.

Hopefully the code and explanations have been presented in a clear and easy to follow way, but please contact me if you have any questions / notice any issues.
