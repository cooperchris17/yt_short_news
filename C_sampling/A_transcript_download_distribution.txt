Corpus Size(pre-cleaning)

I downloaded every available transcript for all videos
with a length of <4 mins uploaded to each of the channels 
in 2021

Number of texts in corpus:  21,149
Total tokens in corpus:  7,270,791
Mean text length:  343.79
Standard deviation:  162.07

Texts per channel:
ABC News                 	1990
Al Jazeera English       	2507
Arirang News              2842
BBC News                  982
CBC News                  667
CGTN          	          2024
CNA                      	2515
DW News                  	422
Nippon TV News 24 Japan   876
TVC News Nigeria         	2855
WION                     	2465
i24NEWS English          	1004

I decided to randomly sample 720 texts from each channel
(except CBC News and DW News, where I used all of the texts)

This gave a balance of having an even number of texts across 
most channels and including all of the channels, even if
two were under-represented

After sampling:

Number of texts in corpus:  8,287
Total tokens in corpus:  2,938,214
Mean text length:  354.56
Standard deviation:  173.6
