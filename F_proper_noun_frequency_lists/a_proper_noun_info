named entity recognition (ner) was used to indentify proper nouns
- nltk didn't tag many proper nouns correctly (due to lower case text)
- spaCy did, but tagged individual tokens (e.g. 'united' and 'states', not 'united states')

- ner is also possible in spaCy, but I chose 'Jean-Baptiste/roberta-large-ner-english' on Hugging Face
https://huggingface.co/Jean-Baptiste/roberta-large-ner-english
- as 'In particular the model seems to work better on entity that don't start with an upper case.'
- this seemed to be true when testing on a small number of texts compared with other models

A brief comparison of nltk/spacy/roberta-large-ner-english model are shown in 'b_brief_propn_comparison.pdf'

One downside of using roberta-large-ner-english is the processing time was very long
